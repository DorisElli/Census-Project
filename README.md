# Census-Project
This report presents an in-depth analysis of a census conducted in a moderately sized town, aiming to provide recommendations for future investments in services and potential development on an unused plot of land. The report begins by detailing the data cleaning process, addressing data errors and missing records.

Subsequent sections delve into various analyses to support the recommendations. This includes an examination of the town's population demographics, predicted population growth, employment trends, commuters, and occupancy rates.

# Data Cleaning
The census data underwent a thorough cleaning process, which included imputing missing data, handling outliers, and addressing issues like misleading entries in religious affiliation. A full logbook of the data cleaning process is available in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.

# Population Demographics
After the data cleaning was completed, the final dataset was structured for analysis. Key demographic features were added, including age bands, employment categories, household occupancy, and final salary. This allowed for a more detailed examination of the town's population.

# Detailed Analysis
The report provides an insightful demographic analysis of the town's population, employment trends, religious affiliations, marital status, and more. For instance, it identifies potential emigration and immigration patterns, examines birth and death rates, and investigates employment and commuter statistics.

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis, several recommendations are made. These include proposals for building a train station to accommodate commuters, investing in low-density housing, and planning for future care services due to the town's aging population. The report emphasizes the need to prioritize age-old care services and suggests that other investments in infrastructure or education may not be immediately necessary.

This comprehensive census project report provides valuable insights into the town's demographics and offers data-driven recommendations for its future development and service planning.
